
Steps I am using to Construct this Solution
===========================================

Define Packages - In Project #2 these are all part of the same process
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Create empty Visual Studio Solution
- Create default console projects for:
  - TestHarness
  - Client
  - ClientWindow
  - Communication
  - Repository 
  - LoadAndExecute
  - ITest
  - TestDriver
  - TestedCode
  - Logger
  - Messages
  - MessageTest
  - BlockingQueue - from Project2HelpF16

Define communication between packages neccessary for testing.  For testing we need to:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- send test requests from Client Server to TestHarness Server
- send test requests from TestHarness Server to child AppDomains
- send file requests from TestHarness Server to Repository Server, sending path
- Repository will write files into path supplied from child AppDomain
- Child AppDomain will send results to TestHarness Server
- TestHarness Server will send results to Client Server and Logs to Repository Server
